This is an animal program that uses polymorphism to use a speak, habitat, and types of method to display different info to the user. I used a couple abstract classes for security measures. This program also reads sentences about animals from a file, processes the data, and stores the sentences. It then displays these sentences to the user in a readable format. This involves file I/O operations for reading and outputting data. I worked with Ben and Rafael. My sources are coding with John, Bro Code and https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/IOException.html
